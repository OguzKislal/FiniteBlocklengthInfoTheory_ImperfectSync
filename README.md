# FiniteBlocklengthInfoTheory_ImperfectSync
This repository contains the source codes to reproduce the Information theory related results of the paper "Is Synchronization a Bottleneck for Pilot-Assisted URLLC Links?"

All results in the paper obtained using the resources provided Chalmers e-commons. Simulations may take a long time depending on the resources used to run the simulations.

Scripts required to obtain some of the results missing at the moment. I will continue to update the repository to reproduce all results in the paper and improve the readibility of the code. Note that all MATLAB functions that is required to obtain the results are already available here. 

If you would like to contribute or have a question, please contact kislal@chalmers.se.
